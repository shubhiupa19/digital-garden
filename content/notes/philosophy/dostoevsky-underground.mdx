Dostoevsky's Underground Man is furious at the idea that humans are rational actors who always pursue their self-interest. His argument: sometimes people deliberately act against their own interest *just to prove they can.*

## The Argument Against Rational Systems

The whole novella is essentially a rejection of utilitarianism and rational planning. The Underground Man says: you can build the most perfect, rational system in the world, and someone will smash it just because they can. Because freedom — even the freedom to act irrationally — is more fundamental than comfort.

## Why This Matters for System Design

This connects to something I think about a lot in tech and crypto: you can design the most elegant incentive structure, but humans aren't purely rational agents. They'll grief, troll, act against their interests, and find creative ways to break your system.

Any system that assumes rational actors is fragile. The robust systems are the ones that account for human irrationality — that build in slack for people being weird, emotional, and unpredictable.

## Still Thinking About

Is the Underground Man right? Is there something valuable about irrationality itself, or is he just being contrarian? I keep going back and forth.
