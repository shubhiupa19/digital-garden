"Don't trust, verify" is the unofficial motto of the crypto world. But as a philosophical position, it's more nuanced than it seems.

## The Limits of Verification

You can't verify everything. Life is too short, and most of us lack the expertise to verify claims in medicine, law, engineering, and a hundred other domains. We *have* to trust.

The real question isn't "should we trust or verify?" It's "what should we trust, what should we verify, and how do we make good decisions about where to draw that line?"

## Kierkegaard and the Leap of Faith

Kierkegaard argued that at some point, you have to make a leap — a commitment that goes beyond what evidence alone can justify. This applies to trust too. No amount of verification can give you certainty. At some point, you choose to trust.

The crypto movement is essentially trying to shrink the domain where leaps of faith are necessary. That's valuable. But it can't eliminate them entirely.

## Trust as a Social Technology

Trust itself is a technology — one of humanity's most powerful. It allows us to cooperate at scale, to build things no individual could build alone. Replacing all trust with verification wouldn't just be impractical; it would be impoverishing.

The goal should be to build systems where trust is **justified and resilient**, not systems where trust is unnecessary.
