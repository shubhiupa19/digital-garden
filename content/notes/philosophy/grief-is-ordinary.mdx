Recently, I came across a Youtube video of actor Jesse Eisenberg accepting a
BAFTA award for his film "A Real Pain". In his speech, he said that his wife
taught him that grief is unexceptional. I'd never heard someone describe it that
way, and as someone who spent the latter half of last year struggling with grief
and loss, it resonated with me deeply.

Grief, pain, and suffering, are all an innate part of the human condition. We
can't avoid them. This idea isn't new; Buddhism teaches that dukkha (often
translated as suffering), is a constant thread running through the tapestry of
life. Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky wrote in his short story "The Dream of a
Ridiculous Man", that we can only love through suffering; that is, love and
suffering are intertwined and inseparable. And when you're drowning in grief,
it's easy to feel completely alone in it – like it's uniquely, privately yours.

In these moments, I try hard to remind myself that grief is ordinary. As poet
Neil Hilborn said, "Whatever you’re feeling right now, there is a mathematical
certainty that someone else is feeling that exact same thing. That is not to say
you’re not special, this is to say thank god you aren’t special."

I'm finding myself more accepting and less afraid of the waves of grief when
they come now, knowing that this feeling is a ticket that admits me to the
human race.
