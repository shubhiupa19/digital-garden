Before Bitcoin, digital things couldn't be scarce. You could copy any file infinitely. Bitcoin created the first digitally scarce asset — and that's a bigger deal than most people realize.

## Why Scarcity Matters

Scarcity is one of the foundations of economic value. Not the only one — utility, demand, and social consensus matter too — but without scarcity, it's hard to store value over time.

Bitcoin's 21 million coin cap creates absolute scarcity, which is something that doesn't exist even in the physical world (we can always mine more gold, find more diamonds).

## The Philosophical Question

Is artificial scarcity ethical? We now have the ability to make things infinitely abundant (digital files, information), but we choose to make them scarce. When is that justified?

This is a question I'm still sitting with. There's a difference between scarcity that protects creators and scarcity that extracts rent.
