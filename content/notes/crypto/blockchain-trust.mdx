The entire premise of blockchain is: what if we didn't need to trust anyone?

That's a radical proposition. Our entire civilization is built on trust — trust
in banks, governments, corporations, each other. Blockchain doesn't eliminate
trust; it shifts it from people and institutions to math and code.

## Trust Is a Spectrum

It's tempting to frame this as "trustless vs. trust-based," but that's too
simple. Every system sits somewhere on a spectrum:

1. **Full trust**: I believe you because I know you (personal relationships)
2. **Institutional trust**: I believe you because a third party vouches for you
   (banks, courts)
3. **Cryptographic trust**: I can verify the claim myself without trusting
   anyone (blockchain)

## The Real Innovation

The insight isn't "we don't need trust." It's that **we can make certain types
of trust unnecessary** by replacing them with verifiable computation.

You still trust that the protocol is correctly designed. You still trust that
the cryptography hasn't been broken. But you don't need to trust that your bank
won't freeze your account or that a government won't devalue your currency.

## The Human Cost of Low Trust

Here's what gets missed in the crypto discourse: living in a low-trust society
is psychologically expensive. When you can't trust institutions, you have to
verify everything yourself. That's exhausting.

The best blockchain systems aren't the ones that eliminate all trust — they're
the ones that **make the right things easy to verify** while keeping the system
usable for humans who have finite time and attention.
