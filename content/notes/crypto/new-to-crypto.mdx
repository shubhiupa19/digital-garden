When I walked into ETHDenver last week, I had a clear expection of what I would
feel like: energized, curious, maybe a little in over my head but so excited
that it wouldn't matter. I'm a CS grad. I've built more full-stack applications
than I can count. I've built ML models and have a strong foundation in data
structures & algorithms.
