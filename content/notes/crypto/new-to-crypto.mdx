When I walked into ETHDenver last week, I had a clear expectation of what I
would feel like: energized, curious, maybe a little in over my head but so
excited that it wouldn't matter. I'm a CS grad with a strong technical
foundation. I'd assumed that even if I didn't know everything, I would still
feel like I belonged. Unfortunately, that was not the case.

Within the first ten minutes, I made a beeline to the only booth I vaguely
recognized and Googled words from its poster on my phone before I felt ready to
approach anyone. People around me were exchanging Twitter handles like business
cards; meanwhile, I didn't even have a Twitter account. I heard the word
"protocol" at least ten times, and the only thing that came to mind was HTTP.

I spent most of that first day feeling as if I needed to go home, do at least
six months of research, and come back when I was more prepared.

However, in the time since that day, I've started to realize that you don't need
to be an expert in blockchain and cryptocurrency to belong in the space; you
just need to be interested in the problems it's trying to solve.

## The Problem of Forced Trust

When I first applied to NYU in December 2021, I was required to provide nearly
all of my personal information: home address, Social Security Number, family
income, etc. At the time, I didn't think much of it, assuming that this was just
the status quo.

Then, in March 2025, the [website was hacked](https://nyunews.com/news/2025/03/22/nyu-website-hacked-data-leak/), exposing the data of more than three million people, likely including my own.
I found out about it through Instagram, and the incident shocked and angered me.
What were my personal credentials doing in an NYU database nearly three years
after I had enrolled? And why weren't NYU's systems secure enough to handle such
sensitive information?

I felt betrayed because it hadn't even been my choice to disclose this
information. I either had to provide my personal details, or not apply at all.
This is known as forced trust – a situation in which people are required to rely
on a technology due to lack of alternatives.

In the day-to-day, this may seem insignificant. People tap their credit card and
create accounts with various websites that require personal details without a
second thought as to where their data is going. However, when you take a step
back, the consequences of your sensitive data being exposed can be catastrophic.
Imagine what could happen if your financial information and your identity
information got into the wrong hands. Your _entire life_ could be ruined. Your
identity could be stolen, your credit destroyed, and much worse, leaving years'
worth of damage to undo.

This realization made things click for me as a technologist and as someone who
no longer wants to be unable to control their _own_ data.

## About the Crypto Scams

The first thing people usually do when I tell them I'm interested in the crypto
space is rattle off a list of recent scams in the industry.

While I understand the legitimacy of rug pulls, volatility, and fraud schemes, I
would counter: what about all of the scams in the TradFi space? I would remind
them of the [Bernie Madoff Ponzi scheme](https://www.fbi.gov/history/famous-cases/bernie-madoff)
which racked up billions of dollars over decades, Wells Fargo's fake accounts
scandal, and predatory lending that contributed to the 2008 crisis. Shockingly,
only [one Wall Street banker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kareem_Serageldin)
in the United States was imprisoned as a result of the 2008 crisis, while
millions of ordinary Americans lost homes and jobs.

Overall, traditional finance is subject to scams and issues as well. Rather, our
society has judged its failures as anomalies while attributing the scams of
crypto to its essence.

Of course, there's no denying that crypto has its problems, but the comparison
isn't as fair as people make it out to be.

## How I Began to Understand the Space

For a while, my support of crypto was driven more by intuition than granular
understanding. I knew that the space was broadly about decentralizing power
structures and handing data ownership back to the people, which resonated with
me before I had any terminology to explain my thoughts.

After the basics, the first concept I learned was liquidity pools, which opened
my eyes to how powerful crypto could be for ordinary people.

In traditional finance, market makers, or wealthy institutions like Citadel and
Jane Street, are the entities who provide liquidity for stock exchanges. They
sit in the middle of trades and profit from the spread, while the average
investor has no way to partake in this wealth.

However, on a decentralized exchange like Uniswap, anyone can deposit tokens
into a liquidity pool and earn fees from trades that happen against it, rather
than just the institutions.

To the average person, this likely sounds like a small technical detail.
However, to me, it felt like a counterargument to a system that only rewards
those who were already powerful while excluding ordinary people who were just
trying to get ahead.

## The Gaps in My Understanding

In the interest of honesty, there are still many complex terms and concepts I
don't understand. I am still wrapping my mind around restaking, lending
protocols, rollups, SNARKs and STARKs. There's a lot of the technical
architecture I'm still working through, and I'm sure there are things I
currently believe that I'll eventually revise.

However, what I want to emphasize is that believing in something doesn't mean
mastering every detail of it first. For example, I believe in democracy without
knowing every single argument written by every single political philosopher who
influenced it. I believe in the importance of exercising and eating well without
being a doctor. Understanding why something is beneficial often precedes
understanding its mechanics; preaching otherwise is what keeps people out of the
discourse.

## The Caveats of Cryptocurrency

Despite all of crypto's benefits, there are some very real tensions worth
acknowledging.

Primarily, pure decentralization, as an ideal, would be chaos. Most crypto
applications still rely on centralized infrastructure _somewhere_ in the stack
through reliance on cloud providers, front-end interfaces, and the core teams
maintaining protocols/applications. In other words, decentralization exists on a
spectrum rather than a binary; most applications of crypto, and by extension,
blockchain, sit somewhere in the middle.

Further, cryptographic proofs, while mathematically elegant, still rely on human
trust for adoption. While proofs can verify the validity of transactions, they
cannot stop people from making bad decisions, being deceived by scammers, and
building communities that unintentionally recreate the same exclusionary culture
that the industry is supposed to disrupt.

It's worth holding both of these truths at once: blockchain technology is full
of potential, but it's not a panacea.

## How Do We Democratize the Space?

If blockchain is supposed to democratize finance, why does it feel like I need
to have all of this background knowledge just to enter the space?

I stood at ETHDenver Googling words on my phone because I was too embarrassed to
ask someone about their poster. If I felt that way as a CS grad who understands
technical terms, I can only imagine what it would feel like for someone without
that background.

I don't have a full solution yet, but I think it starts with people being
unafraid to admit that they don't understand things, which is what I'm trying to
do here.

## The Bottom Line

Ultimately, you don't have to understand crypto and blockchain to believe in its
capabilities. You just have to be tired of handing over your data to
untrustworthy institutions and hoping for the best. You have to want better for
the future than just accepting data breaches as the cost of living in the modern
world.

One foot in the door is enough to start.
