Your working memory can hold roughly 4-7 items at once. Everything we design — interfaces, explanations, protocols — either respects this limit or fights against it.

## The Three Types

1. **Intrinsic load**: The inherent difficulty of the material
2. **Extraneous load**: Difficulty added by poor design or explanation
3. **Germane load**: The productive effort of building mental models

Good design minimizes extraneous load to free up capacity for germane load. Bad design wastes your limited cognitive resources on irrelevant complexity.

## Implications for Crypto UX

Crypto interfaces are notorious for high extraneous load. Gas fees, wallet addresses, seed phrases — these are all implementation details that leak into the user experience. The material is already intrinsically complex; bad UX makes it worse.

The best crypto products will be the ones that hide the complexity without hiding the principles.
