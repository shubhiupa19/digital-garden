Why do people trust institutions? And more importantly, why do they stop?

Trust in institutions — governments, banks, media, scientific bodies — has been declining for decades in many countries. Understanding why requires going beyond politics into psychology.

## Trust Is Built on Predictability

At a basic level, we trust things that behave predictably. When an institution repeatedly does what it says it will do, trust builds. When it doesn't, trust erodes.

But there's a deeper layer: **we trust institutions that we believe share our values and interests.** This is why trust breakdowns often happen along identity lines — people don't just ask "is this institution competent?" but "is this institution for people like me?"

## The Trust Tax

Low institutional trust imposes a psychological "tax" on everyone. When you can't trust your bank, you check your balance obsessively. When you can't trust the news, you cross-reference every claim. When you can't trust your employer, you document everything.

This cognitive overhead is real and measurable. It takes bandwidth away from other things — creativity, relationships, long-term planning.

## The Crypto Connection

This is part of why crypto resonates with certain demographics. It promises to replace institutional trust with cryptographic verification. But here's the tension: **the people who need trust alternatives the most are often the least equipped to navigate the technical complexity of crypto.**

Building systems that are both trustless and accessible is one of the hardest design challenges in the space.
