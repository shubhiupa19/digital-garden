This garden exists because I believe in learning in public. Here's why.

## The Case for Showing Your Work

When you learn in private, your ideas never get challenged. You can hold contradictory beliefs indefinitely because no one pushes back. Publishing half-formed thoughts invites feedback, correction, and connection.

## The Vulnerability Tax

Learning in public is uncomfortable. You're exposing your ignorance alongside your knowledge. Every seedling note is an admission: "I don't fully understand this yet."

But that vulnerability is also what makes it authentic. People trust someone who says "I'm still figuring this out" more than someone who pretends to have all the answers.

## The Compound Effect

Ideas published in public create unexpected connections. Someone reads your note on ZK proofs and connects it to a concept from psychology you hadn't considered. The garden grows in directions you couldn't have planned.

That's the whole point. A garden you fully control isn't a garden — it's a museum.
