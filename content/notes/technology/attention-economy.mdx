Your attention is the most valuable resource in the digital economy. Every app, platform, and notification is competing for it — and most of them are winning.

## The Basic Economics

Advertising-funded platforms have a simple business model: capture attention, sell it to advertisers. The better they are at capturing your attention, the more money they make. This creates a structural incentive to make products as addictive as possible.

## The Design Problem

The same design principles that make software "user-friendly" can make it manipulative:
- **Variable rewards** (like a slot machine) keep you scrolling
- **Social validation** (likes, followers) hijacks our need for belonging
- **FOMO triggers** create anxiety when you're not using the platform

## Beyond Individual Responsibility

"Just put your phone down" isn't a solution. These products are designed by teams of brilliant engineers and psychologists to be hard to put down. Individual willpower is not a match for institutional design.

The real solutions are structural: regulation, alternative business models, and designing technology that respects human attention instead of exploiting it.

## Connection to Crypto

Decentralized social media (Farcaster, Lens Protocol) offers an interesting alternative: what if the platform didn't own your data and didn't need advertising revenue? Could we build social experiences that aren't incentivized to steal your attention?

Early experiments are promising but still rough around the edges.
