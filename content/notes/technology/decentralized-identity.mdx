Who gets to say who you are? Right now, the answer is mostly governments and corporations. Your identity is stored in their databases, verified by their systems, and revoked at their discretion.

Decentralized identity flips this: **you own your identity, and you choose what to share.**

## How It Could Work

Using ZK proofs, you could prove things about yourself without revealing the underlying data:
- Prove you're over 18 without sharing your birthdate
- Prove you graduated from a university without revealing your grades
- Prove you have enough money for a loan without revealing your balance

## The Hard Problems

- **Recovery**: If you lose your private key, you lose your identity. No "forgot password" button
- **Sybil resistance**: How do you prevent one person from creating many identities?
- **Social acceptance**: Will institutions actually accept decentralized credentials?

This is early, messy, and fascinating. I'm tracking projects like Worldcoin, ENS, and Spruce ID to see how this develops.
