Today I learned about the Byzantine Generals Problem and how it relates to distributed consensus. The analogy of generals needing to coordinate an attack without a trusted messenger really clicked — it makes the blockchain consensus problem feel intuitive.

Still confused about how BFT relates to Nakamoto consensus though. They feel like fundamentally different approaches to the same problem, but I'm not sure I can articulate the difference clearly yet. Adding this to my "still figuring out" list.
