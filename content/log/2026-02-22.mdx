Launched the garden today. It feels strange to publish things that aren't
finished, but that's kind of the point. The hardest part wasn't the technical
setup — it was deciding what counts as "good enough to publish."

Realized that the connection between zero-knowledge proofs and institutional
trust is deeper than I initially thought. When you can prove something without
revealing it, you're fundamentally changing the trust equation. Need to think
more about the implications for identity systems.
