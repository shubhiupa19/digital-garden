Spent the morning reading about zk-STARKs and trying to understand the difference between SNARKs and STARKs at a deeper level. The "no trusted setup" property of STARKs is really compelling, but the proof sizes are larger. Tradeoffs everywhere.

Also started reading *Notes from Underground* again. Every time I read it I notice something new. This time I'm thinking about how the Underground Man's rejection of rational self-interest maps onto critiques of mechanism design in crypto. People don't always act in their economic self-interest, and systems that assume they will are brittle.
